                                             BAKERY MANAGEMENT
                                             -----------------


I have created api for bakery manegement without using of frontend.

There are two types of Modules :-

1) Admin
2) Users

Use of application:-

        This application is based on url pattern because It is the api based application. After creating application First of all we will write command for runserver this will generate a URL and we will add the modules with url with the the help of '/' and will get the API of that modules.

Functionality:-

        This project is made for bakery management. There are alots of features available in this application by the help of this , we can see all sold product or available product etc. using this application, we have created some features for admin and users.

    
    Admin-  Admin can registration with this app and login also.For admin I have created api to add product ,   
            update product, delete product and retrieve product .
            Admin also can perform on users like as can delete their account and can add also.

    Users - User can also registration with this app and login also. For users I have created api to get all 
            product details or a single product details.

Testing of appliction:-
        I tested this application using POSTMAN tool.

        Using this tool I tested that all features are working or not like as I am able to fetch the product or not , delete the product or not , update the product or not and create the new product or not.
